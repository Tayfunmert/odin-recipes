            </li>
            <li>
                Onion and garlic: An onion and two cloves of garlic are cooked with the meat to add tons of flavor.
            </li>
            <li>
                Tomato products: You'll need a can of crushed tomatoes, two cans of tomato sauce, and two cans of tomato paste.
            </li>
            <li>
                Sugar: Two tablespoons of white sugar add subtle sweetness and enhance the flavor of the sauce.
            </li>
            <li>
                Spices and seasonings: This lasagna recipe is flavored with fresh parsley, dried basil leaves, salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and black pepper.
            </li>
            <li>
                Lasagna noodles: Use store-bought or homemade lasagna noodles.
            </li>
            <li>
                Cheeses: Parmesan, mozzarella, and ricotta cheese make this lasagna extra decadent.
            </li>
                Egg: An egg helps bind the ricotta so it doesn't ooze out of the lasagna when you cut into it.
